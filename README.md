# ⚠️ AI-Generated Proof Concepts

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

The documents in this folder contain **AI-GENERATED MATHEMATICAL CONTENT**.

### What these are:
- Conceptual examples of what formal verification *might* look like
- Inspiration for actual mathematicians/verification experts
- Demonstrations of the *style* of rigor needed

### What these are NOT:
- **Verified proofs**
- **Mathematically correct**
- **Safety guarantees**
- **Peer-reviewed work**

### Status:
- ❌ Not formally verified
- ❌ Not peer-reviewed  
- ❌ May contain errors
- ❌ Should not be cited
- ❌ Do not rely for safety claims

### Purpose:
These are included transparently to show:
1. The *type* of formal work needed
2. The *gap* between concept and proof
3. An invitation for experts to contribute real verification
