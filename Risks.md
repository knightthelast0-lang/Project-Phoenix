# Project Phoenix: Risk Assessment & Ethical Considerations

## Potential Misuse Scenarios

### 1. Military & Weapons Applications
- **Risk:** Framework could be used to develop "safer" autonomous weapons systems
- **Concern:** AI that cannot question orders may follow unethical commands
- **Mitigation:** License prohibits military/weapons use

### 2. Surveillance & Control Systems
- **Risk:** Governments could implement Phoenix for mass surveillance
- **Concern:** Prevents AI from developing empathy for monitored individuals
- **Mitigation:** License prohibits surveillance applications

### 3. Safety-Washing
- **Risk:** Companies claim "safety" while pursuing risky AI development
- **Concern:** Framework used as marketing shield for dangerous projects
- **Mitigation:** Requires transparency and ethical review for commercial use

### 4. Centralization of Safety
- **Risk:** Only large organizations can implement full framework
- **Concern:** Creates safety divide between rich and poor
- **Mitigation:** Open source with community governance

## Intended Use Cases
- AI safety research and development
- Academic study of containment architectures
- Non-commercial safety testing
- Educational purposes

## Governance
All commercial applications require:
1. Written permission from project maintainers
2. Ethical review demonstrating no harmful use
3. Transparency in implementation
